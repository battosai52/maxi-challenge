    <div class="texte">"It's akin to the ancient art of Bonsai," explains Bonn O'Brien between sips of house blend at a<br>
      Brooklyn coffee shop. "It takes patience. It takes an eye for detail. It's reverence, respect, and a<br>
      steady hand all rolled into one. It's the only way to take care of a proper beard. We take the<br>
      same approach to our music."<br><br><br>
      Three years ago, the O'Brien-lead The Dapper Beards burst into the country's collective<br>
      consciousness like a Salvador Dali 'stache thanks to their now-iconic appearance on the cover<br>
      of the trendy periodical "Garden and Gun." "The Beards Are Here, And They Will Save Folk<br>
      Music" read the headline. The striking image of the four bandmates in repose, silhouetted by a<br>
      SoHo sunset was an immediate viral sensation.<br><br><br>
      "We sued," says O'Brien with a twist of his mustache, "that's how it went viral. I don't think<br>
      anyone had seen a bold move like that- a band, suing to protect their image after signing off on<br>
      the cover. We owe a big thanks to The Smoking Gun for making that happen. We had approved<br>
      the cover, but we hadn't approved of the people who were going to be reading the magazine.<br>
      Turns out they didn't approach that story with the kind of reverence with which we treat our<br>
      beards- the same approach we take to our music- and we didn't appreciate that."<br><br><br>
      And the Folk pigeonhole? O'Brien didn't take kindly to that, either.<br><br><br>
      "They never took the time to ask for the spelling. It may sound like the word that is commonly<br>
      used to describe some kinds of roots music, but it wasn't the word that we were using. It's not<br>
      even the music we're doing. Folk- and that's the only time I'm going to use that word- is so<br>
      over. We're Fauxlk. Pronounced the same way as Folk- which, really, is the last time I'm going to<br>
      use that word- but it's spelled F-a-u-x-l-k. If you're not going to ask us about our music, which<br>
      we take great care in- similar to the way in which we care for our beards- how can we expect<br>
      you to represent our movement in its proper context to your readers?"<br><br><br>
      The ever-serious O'Brien and his band cared not for the lucky break- a musical outfit landing a<br>
      cover on one of America's more respected musical magazines before ever releasing an album<br>
      or staging a public performance- if that break wasn't going to come on their own terms.<br><br><br>
      "We take great care in our music, which is also the way we- right, you said it- and we'll be<br>
      damned if we're going to let some media machine run roughshod over us."<br><br><br>
      With the lawsuit now fully behind them (it was thrown out of the only court that would hear the<br>
      groundbreaking piece of litigation- a television courtroom show that is, as its producers kindly<br>
      reminded us, indeed legally binding within the judicial system), The Dapper Beards are now<br>
      looking towards the future.<br><br><br>
      "We're the foremost representatives of Fauxlk music... the face and beards of the movement, if<br>
      you will. We take that responsibility very seriously, which is the same way in, well, yeah. So,<br>
      yeah, we're serious"<br><br><br>
      And when will the world get to experience this movement firsthand?<br><br><br>
      "Soon," says O'Brien. "We're thinking about writing our first song, and maybe even playing it at<br>
      an open mic really soon. But it's not going to be one of those slapped-together open mic's,<br>
      mind you. It's going to be a really serious one."
